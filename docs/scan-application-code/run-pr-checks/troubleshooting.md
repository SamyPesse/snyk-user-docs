| PR Check not triggered.                                                   | The repository is imported to Snyk, but when a PR is raised it does not trigger a PR Check.                  | <ol><li>Check the <a href="configure-pr-checks.md">Project and Integration settings</a> to make sure PR checks are configured.</li><li>Check the Project Settings integration page for a banner advising you that a webhook is <a data-footnote-ref href="#user-content-fn-1">absent</a>.<br><br>Double-check integration permission scopes (see <a href="../../integrations/git-repository-scm-integrations/">Git repositories</a>).<br><br>If you still can't create a webhook you can <a href="https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/requests/new">contact support</a>.</li></ol> |
| PR Check is expected but does not run.                                    | The PR check is listed in the Git repository (SCM) as expected but never completes.                          | <p>This issue is generally caused by a Branch Protection rule requiring the PR check. If the Project has been disabled or removed from Snyk, the PR check will not run, but the branch protection rule is still in force until removed or edited.<br><br>Check for Branch Protection rules and confirm that the Project is imported and active.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Multiple "Security" and "Licence" PR Checks run on a single Pull Request. | When raising a PR, multiple Snyk PR checks of the same type run against it, possibly with different results. | <p>If a repository is imported into multiple Snyk Organizations, PR checks will run on the repository for any configured Organization.<br><br>Check the name of the PR check as it includes the Organization name against which the check is run. Alternatively, selecting the PR Check details will take you to the results for the relevant Organization.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Open source and licensing

If you come across false positive or false negative results, you can take action to diagnose and report the issue.

| Scenario       | Description                                                                                             | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
